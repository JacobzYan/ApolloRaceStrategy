# Save the information in some datastructure for each iteration, pass the whole structure between functions
#   - Seperate out parameters into different Dicts, only pass smaller amount to each functions?

# Paramaters file seperately
#   - Constants
#   - Translate Cardinal Directions (maybe do this when the route data is called?)
#   - Car Paramaters
# Function for state update - package sub-functions for each aspect
#   - Battery Thermal Model
#   - Solar Panel Model
#   - Car Mechanical Domain Model 
# Function to pull state info for timestep
#   - Assume all the time changes are linear, model things as ramp function with ICs
# Make own .pathdata file?
